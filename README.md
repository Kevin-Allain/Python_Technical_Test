You can stop running python by typing "exit()".

To run this file, you need to open up a terminal, navigate to where the file technical_test_clean.py is located (if you don't know how to, you can read this https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cd-cmd-command/)
Once the navigator in the right repository, type "python technical_test_clean.py". The program will generate the expected output.
